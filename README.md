# RPS-game
The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors (later adding Fire, Water Sponge, Air) practice. In this file, I will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game where people can play against a randomly generated answer from the computer. The game will keep score and decide who wins using JavaScript algorithms.
